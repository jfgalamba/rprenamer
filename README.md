# Bulk Renamer in Python with PySide6

As mentioned in [Real Python ](https://realpython.com/bulk-file-rename-tool-python/):

>    Say you need to rename multiple files in your personal folder using a 
>    specific naming pattern. Doing that manually can be time-consuming and
>    error-prone. So, youâ€™re thinking of automating the file renaming process by 
>    building your own bulk file rename tool using Python. If so, then this 
>    tutorial is for you.

This code "improves" on the example given in RealPython, by providing a 
`ThreadedRenamer` and an `AsyncRenamer` (using `qasync`).
